# War of the Ring Online Tools
This is a repository for random tools you might use with War of the Rings.

This module color codes the regions based on the distance of the clicked region. The colors form rings around the given region; there are 5 colors, so each matching ring is 5 steps away from the last one. For now you have to manually reload the page after each click.

You may contribute by accurately mapping the areas which I have not finished yet.
